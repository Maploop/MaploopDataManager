# Maploop's Data Manager
This is basically an application that allows you to manage your passwords, credit cards, or any form or "written data"
in an organized way.

## Features
- Organizes each "document" of data into its own .SHEN file
- Allows you to add, remove, and edit data
- Basic level of security using a binary and base64 encryption

## Planned Features
- Allow you to export your dat to a .CSV or a .JSON file
- Allow you to import your data from a .CSV or a .JSON file
- Allow you to search across all your data
- Increase data security by introducing encryption keys etc.

## Usage
Note: This application is still in development and is not yet fully functional. Therefore, I am not going to document the usage of this application just yet.

## Contrubuting
Contributing is closed right now. The application needs to be re-written in a much cleaner and much more functional codebase.
